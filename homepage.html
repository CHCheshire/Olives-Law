            <p>This is my story, please could you share the link to my epetition with colleagues, family and friends across all your social media platforms. 
                That would be brilliant, and if your organization could put it briefly on their website that would be great.</p>
            <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/627740">Link to the petition</a>
            <p>My Mum, Olive, started with Vascular Dementia about 6 years ago, looking back at the beginning of the process there was a time that was extremely stressful - this was when we had to get her finances in order, whilst she still could remember what was where. 
                But in order to do this, we had to ring around every single company - utilities, insurance, pensions, banks etc, each time Mum had to initially go on the phone to give me permission to talk on her behalf etc and every phonecall was painful and stressful for Mum. 
                This shouldn't be the case, so I've thought of a much simpler solution and I've put an epetition into the Government to try to get it out into law. </p>
            <p>Is there any chance that your organization could sign and share my e-petition, please?  
                I don't need any funding, I just need signatures....100,000 to be exact by 16th May 2023.</p>

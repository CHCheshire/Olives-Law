            <p>This is my story, please could you share the link to my epetition with colleagues, family and friends across all your social media platforms. 
                That would be brilliant, and if your organization could put it briefly on their website that would be great.</p>

            <p><br>My Mum, Olive, started with Vascular Dementia about 6 years ago, looking back at the beginning of the process there was a time that was extremely stressful - this was when we had to get her finances in order, whilst she still could remember what was where. 
                But in order to do this, we had to ring around every single company - utilities, insurance, pensions, banks etc, each time Mum had to initially go on the phone to give me permission to talk on her behalf etc and every phonecall was painful and stressful for Mum. 
                This shouldn't be the case, so I've thought of a much simpler solution and I've put an epetition into the Government to try to get it out into law. </p>
            <p>Is there any chance that your organization could sign and share my e-petition, please?  
                I don't need any funding, I just need signatures....100,000 to be exact by 16th May 2023.</p>
            <p>Below is a letter my daughter wrote, on my behalf, and it contains further details of my epetition. </p>
            <p>Thank you in advance. </p>
            <br>

                    <h3>To anyone who has ever seen a beloved older relative struggle with technology…</h3>
                    <p>My mum was a cool grandma. The coolest grandma. She listened to UB40 and S Club 7, she used text speech and emoticons before any of us knew what they were, and she even played Brain Trainer on her DS with glee. 
                        And she was good at it! But despite being ahead of the curve, and despite the promises Dr. Kawashima made about the benefits of his DS game, a series of undetectable TIAs have left my mum with advanced vascular dementia. 
                        So all that time she spent keeping up with the technological advances of the 21st century has felt like a waste; technology is no longer a source of entertainment but a source of stress. </p>
                    <p>For those of us who haven’t (yet) fallen victim to the cruelty of dementia - or any condition that can leave intelligent, capable people feeling confused and frustratingly dependent on others, whose names and relations to them they have forgotten - the paperless life feels like a quick, eco-friendly and convenient way to access our adult admin. 
                        Bank transactions, electricity bills, mortgage payments, medical appointments, test results, news; it’s all accessible via the magic of technology. With the cost of living crisis, being in touch with one’s finances is vital, so having all that information immediately accessible is also vital. But what if you have forgotten your password to your online banking account? What if you have forgotten the email address to which you are sent in order to rest that password?
                         What if you have lost the notebook where you kept all this information? What then? </p>
                    <p>This is what has happened to my mum, Olive. 
                        As the younger and more tech-savvy of the pair, she was the one to run all the various accounts she shares with my dad, Geoff. However, she can’t do these things anymore, and my poor 94-year-old dad can’t catch up. And now, I, as their primary carer, am the one who has to rifle through notebooks and websites to try to access all the information that used to be sent directly to their home, on paper. Even though I live an hour away and have a full-time job, a husband and a cat to think about, I spend most of my free time now fighting fires on the other side of the Pennines. 
                        Many of the barriers I face in this care would be easily solved if there were a physical, accessible paper trail of information. 
                        Medical appointments, changes to medication, bills, arrangements for carers - all of it I currently hunt over the phone, spending countless hours explaining that I am the one they need to talk to because Mum has not been able to hold or follow a conversation for many years. </p>
                    <p>While I am happy to do all this for my parents, I think of those without anyone to depend on. 
                        If my parents - with two daughters who love and care for them, 
                        a series of carers and a cleaner who selflessly acts as though she is their third daughter - are still struggling to keep on top of all that admin and red tape because it’s all in the ethereal space we call the internet, then what about those who are alone? What about those who, unlike my mum, never even touched an iPad or a smartphone? What about those who still rely on a dusty PC in the spare room? 
                        Their independence is increasingly threatened by a move towards a paperless system.</p>
                    <p>Please don’t get me wrong. 
                        I understand the significant environmental benefits of a paperless system, and for those of us still able to use technology with ease and confidence,
                         it makes our lives run smoothly. However, according to <a href="http://dementiastatistics.org/">DementiaStatistics.org</a>, it is predicted that over one million people will suffer from dementia by 2030 - my mum started to decline in only the last 10 years, in her 70s. Who do you know that could be experiencing dementia by 2030? Shouldn’t they have the opportunity to remain as independent as possible?
                         Shouldn’t those who care for them have access to all the information they need to do so, in order to make a stressful situation just that much easier?</p>
                    <p>This is what I propose as a solution: Olive’s Law. Olive's Law is an e-petition that I have started to help people to get free, financial paperwork on paper from the age of 70:

                <h3>The main points of this law are:-</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        When someone turns 70 then companies have to offer hardcopies of paperwork, for free. All companies, such as utilities, banks etc already have people's date of birth on their records so they know when someone turns 70.
                        If companies automatically send bills on paper then we are catching a point at which people may be losing their cognitive abilities. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Anyone who is under the age of 70 can also claim under Olive's Law. They can do this by filling out one form at their bank. People may need this if they suffer an illness or a head injury. We need to make this much easier for people. They may have just had a devastating injury or illness diagnosed which has already knocked them sideways, so the last thing they need is to be ringing around all of these companies to arrange hard copies, if required. 
                        Banks already have links to all of these companies and work under GDPR guidelines so, if a person now requires bills and statements etc on paper, they should be able to fill in this one form at their bank so the bank can inform all the companies linked to the bank account that paper copies are now required. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If someone at the age of 70 feels that they don't need paper copies then they can defer for five years. However, the companies will then be responsible to offer paper copies again after those five years. This can also be done with the one form system through the person's own bank. I know from personal experience how quickly one’s ability to manage these things can decline in five years. 
                        We need to capture the moment when everyone's ability to cope with the online world starts to decrease. 
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Some people may never need this service, but there are many for whom it could be essential to the wellbeing of themselves and their families.
                The admin of adulthood is hard enough, but hopefully we can find a way to make it easier for those who deserve the end of their lives to be free of the pressures of remembering emails and passwords and websites when they should be focussing on remembering much more important things.</p>
